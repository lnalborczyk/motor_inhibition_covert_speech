  abstract = {This study aimed to characterise effects of coil orientation on the size of Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs) from both sides of Orbicularis Oris (OO) and both First Dorsal Interosseous (FDI) muscles, following stimulation to left lip and left hand Primary Motor Cortex. Using a 70mm figure-of-eight coil, we collected MEPs from eight different orientations while recording from contralateral and ipsilateral OO and FDI using a monophasic pulse delivered at 120\% active motor threshold. MEPs from OO were evoked consistently for six orientations for contralateral and ipsilateral sites. Contralateral orientations 0\textdegree, 45\textdegree, 90\textdegree, and 315\textdegree{} were found to best elicit OO MEPs with a likely cortical origin. The largest FDI MEPs were recorded for contralateral 45\textdegree, invoking a posterior\textendash anterior (PA) current flow. Orientations traditionally used for FDI were also found to be suitable for eliciting OO MEPs. Individuals vary more in their optimal orientation for OO than for FDI. It is recommended that researchers iteratively probe several orientations when eliciting MEPs from OO. Several orientations likely induced direct activation of facial muscles.},

Although most impulses are motivational or emotional rather than motoric per se, it is research into the neural architecture of motor response control that has made the greatest strides. This article reviews recent developments in the cognitive neuroscience of stopping responses. Most research of this kind has focused on reactive control\textemdash that is, how subjects stop a response outright when instructed by a signal. It is argued that reactive paradigms are limited as models of control relevant to psychiatry. Instead, a set of paradigms is advocated that begins to model proactive inhibitory control\textemdash that is, how a subject prepares to stop an upcoming response tendency. Proactive inhibitory control is generated according to the goals of the subject rather than by an external signal, and it can be selectively targeted at a particular response tendency.

The chapter presents a series of experiments on the role of memory in reasoning, language comprehension, and learning. An attempt is made to apply the comparable techniques in all three cases to allow a common pattern to emerge, if the same working memory system is operative in all three instances. The chapter makes a case for postulating the working memory-LTS system as a modification of the current STS-LTS view. Working memory represents a control system with limits on both its storage and processing capabilities, and has access to phonemically coded information (possibly by controlling a rehearsal buffer), that it is responsible for the limited memory span, but does not underlie the recency effect in free recall. The experiments presented in the chapter suggest that the phonemic rehearsal buffer plays a limited role in this process, but is by no means essential. These experiments also suggest that working memory plays a part in verbal reasoning and in prose comprehension. Understanding the detailed role of working memory in these tasks, however, must proceed hand-in-hand with an understanding of the tasks themselves.},

It can be divided into the following three subcomponents: (i) the central executive, which is assumed to be an attentional-controlling system, is important in skills such as chess playing and is particularly susceptible to the effects of Alzheimer's disease; and two slave systems, namely (ii) the visuospatial sketch pad, which manipulates visual images and (iii) the phonological loop, which stores and rehearses speech-based information and is necessary for the acquisition of both native and second-language vocabulary.},

In the current study, we explored the role of language in one aspect of cognition, namely problem solving, by administering the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) to stroke patients with varying degrees of language impairment (Experiment 1) and to normal participants under conditions of articulatory suppression (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, there was a significant correlation between performance on the WCST and language measures such as comprehension and naming. Demonstrating the specificity of this result, we also found a significant relationship between language performance and another test of problem solving, the Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices, but no relationship between language and a test of visuospatial functioning. In Experiment 2, normal participants were significantly impaired on the WCST under conditions of articulatory suppression, relative to a baseline condition. Together, these findings suggest that language plays a role in complex problem solving, possibly through covert language processes.},

In a model of De Jong, Coles and Logan (1995), (Strategies and mechanisms in nonselective and selective inhibitory motor control. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 21, 3, 498-511), a mechanism for nonselective inhibition operates peripheral to the motor cortex, while a selective mechanism operates at a central cortical level. We argue, however, that a peripheral mechanism of inhibition is incorrectly inferred from inhibition data available to date. Neurophysiological and psychophysiological data suggest that inhibitory processes always involve the cortex, and inhibitory effects are exerted upstream from the primary motor cortex. The prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia are candidate agents of response inhibition, whereas possible sites of inhibition are the thalamus and motor cortex.},

Activation (due to execution) or inhibition (due to imagination) in the previous trial should affect performance in the subsequent trial, enabling conclusions about inhibitory mechanisms in motor imagery. In Experiment 1, evidence for global and effector-specific inhibition was observed. Evidence for inhibition retrieved during target processing was inconclusive. Data patterns were similar when start and end of the imagined movements were indicated with an effector that was part of the imagined movement (hand) and with a different effector (feet). In Experiment 2, we ruled out that the use of biological stimuli (left/right hands in Experiment 1) to indicate the effector causes sequential effects attributed to effector-specific inhibition, by~using uppercase letters (R, L). As in Experiment 1, evidence for effector-specific inhibition was observed. In conclusion, we could reliably disentangle several inhibitory mechanisms in motor imagery.},

  abstract = {A theory is presented concerning the neuronal mechanisms which may underlie the organisation of imagined versus executed movements. A review is first presented of previous theoretical and experimental evidence suggesting that the brain can use the same mechanisms for the imagination and the execution of movement. In particular the fact that adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex can be obtained by pure mental effort and not solely by conflicting visual and vestibular cues has been suggestive of the fact that the brain could internally simulate conflicts and use the same adaptive mechanisms used when actual sensory cues were in conflict. The saccadic system is taken as a good model for the study of this question because the mechanisms which underlie saccade generation are now partially understood at different levels from the brain stem to the cortex. The central idea of the theory is based upon the fact that, in parallel with the excitatory mechanisms underlying saccade generation, several inhibitory mechanisms in cascade allow the selective modulation and blockage of saccades. Synaptic inhibition is therefore supposed to play a major role in a hierarchical selective gating of saccade execution not at one but at several levels allowing a variety of different types of `imagined movements' some involving only the higher levels some in which the execution is only blocked at the very immediate premotor level. But in all cases the theory proposes that imagination and execution have many mechanisms in common. PET data showing that indeed the same structures are activated in both types of movements support this idea although the final answer will have to be brought by neuronal data.},

The present study proposed to assess the effects of physiological adult ageing on the proprioceptive control of movement and the related internal models. To this aim, one group of young adults and one group of older adults performed an ankle contralateral concurrent matching task in two speed conditions (self-selected and fast). Error, temporal and kinematic variables were used to assess the matching performance. The results demonstrated that older adults used a different mode of control as compared to the young adults and suggested that the internal models of proprioceptive control were altered with ageing. Behavioural expressions of these alterations were dependent upon the considered condition of speed. In the self-selected speed condition, this alteration was expressed through an increased number of corrective sub-movements in older adults as compared to their young peers. This strategy enabled them to reach a level of end-point performance comparable to the young adults' performance. In the fast speed condition, older adults were no more able to compensate for their impaired internal models through additional corrective sub-movements and therefore decreased their proprioceptive control performance. These results provided the basis for a model of proprioceptive control of movement integrating the internal models theory and the continuous and intermittent modes of control. This study also suggested that motor control was affected by the frailty syndrome, i.e. a decreased resistance to stressors, which characterises older adults.},

  abstract = {The divide-and-conquer approach to the study of human cognition has succeeded in focusing researchers' efforts on behavioral phenomena that fall under well-defined categories such as attention, perception, language, memory, emotion, and motor control. The result has been the development of coherent bodies of work in each area replete with successful explanatory theories and a rich collection of paradigms, tasks, and analytic techniques. There has been a renewed in recent years in combining and integrating ideas across these domains, as well as in incorporating neuroscientific data, as a way to build more powerful and general models of cognition. Here we review the history and current state of integration between verbal short-term memory (VeSTM) and language, two domains of study that have significant areas of overlap but have not been fully integrated. We review evidence from cognitive neuroscience that has generally shown VeSTM to greatly depend on the network of brain regions that are known to form the core sensory-motor basis of human language. Whereas classic psychological models of VeSTM posit the existence of dedicated short-term storage buffers, we suggest that temporary verbal memory emerges from the coordinated interplay of a fronto-temporal sensory-motor circuit that has evolved to support the perception and production of speech. Phonological rehearsal in the service of temporary maintenance is achieved by feedforward and feedback pathways connecting the auditory- and motor-speech systems via a sensorymotor interface component situated in the Sylvian-parietal-temporal region (Spt). Reciprocal connectivity between the frontal and temporal speech systems enables the kind of ``round-tripping'' of dual speech codes long hypothesized by cognitive models such as Baddeley and Hitch's ``phonological loop''.},

It was the aim of this cross-sectional study to chart the development of movement imagery over childhood using validated measures, and to examine its relationship to movement skill. A sample of 58 children aged 7\textendash 12 years were recruited from Australian primary schools. Motor imagery ability was assessed using the Radial Pointing Task and a (mental) Hand Rotation Task, whereas visual (or object-related) imagery was measured on a Letter Rotation Task. Motor skill was assessed on the McCarron Assessment of Neuromuscular Development (MAND). Results showed clear age differences on all measures: motor skill, motor imagery, and visual imagery. The relationship between motor imagery and motor skill was shown to become stronger with age, whereas no relationship between visual imagery and motor skill was evident at any age. Taken together, these results show that motor imagery has a distinct developmental trajectory that is entwined with the development of movement skill in children. We argue that movement imagery reflects the unfolding of internal modeling processes providing the foundation for adaptive, goal-directed movements.},

In Section 1, we consider insights into the neural basis of inhibitory control from the effects of neural interference, neural dysfunction, and drug addiction. In Section 2, we explore the functional specificity of inhibitory mechanisms among a range of related processes, including response selection, working memory, and attention. In Section 3, we focus on the contribution of response inhibition to understanding flexible behaviour, including the effects of learning and individual differences.

A hyperdirect pathway between the inferior frontal gyrus and subthalamic nucleus is hypothesized to mediate movement inhibition, but there is limited evidence for this in humans. We recorded high spatial and temporal resolution field potentials from both the inferior frontal gyrus and subthalamic nucleus in 21 subjects. Cortical potentials evoked by subthalamic stimulation revealed short latency events indicative of monosynaptic connectivity between the inferior frontal gyrus and ventral subthalamic nucleus. During a stop signal task, stopping-related potentials in the cortex preceded stopping-related activity in the subthalamic nucleus, and synchronization between these task-evoked potentials predicted the stop signal reaction time. Thus, we show that a prefrontal-subthalamic hyperdirect pathway is present in humans and mediates rapid stopping. These findings may inform therapies to treat disorders featuring perturbed movement inhibition.},

Performance of go/no-go tasks, which are frequently used to investigate response inhibition, recruits a variety of cognitive components besides response inhibition. This article reviews recent findings on the functional localization associated with go/no-go tasks.         Recent findings~         Recent neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies have shown that the presupplementary motor area and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex are crucial for response inhibition and that various subregions of the prefrontal cortex make different contributions leading to successful response inhibition. In particular, functional dissociation has been identified in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, which consists of at least three subregions: the posterior part of the inferior frontal gyrus, inferior frontal junction and inferior frontal gyrus/insula.         Summary~         Neuropsychological studies provide strong evidence that separate subregions of the prefrontal cortex make critical contributions to specific cognitive components involved in response inhibition, whereas neuroimaging studies cannot provide direct evidence regarding the causality, but provide insights into functional localization with high spatial resolution. These methods contribute significantly to our understanding of how executive functions are implemented and should continue to do so into the future.},

A crucial point to our work is noticing that thermodynamics provides a convenient framework to model brain activity, whereas cognition can be modeled in information-theoretical terms. In fact, several models have been proposed so far from both approaches. A second critical remark is the existence of deep theoretical connections between thermodynamics and information theory. In fact, some well-known authors claim that the laws of thermodynamics are nothing but principles in information theory. Unlike in physics or chemistry, a formalization of the relationship between information and energy is currently lacking in neuroscience. In this paper we propose a framework to connect physical brain and cognitive models by means of the theoretical connections between information theory and thermodynamics. Ultimately, this article aims at providing further insight on the formal relationship between cognition and neural activity.},

Individual differences in the capacity to summon discrete aspects of visual imagery can therefore account for the diversity of content generated by humans during future simulation.

  abstract = {All animals need a means by which to distinguish sensory inputs caused by their own movements from sensory inputs that are due to sources in the outside world. One such means is provided by corollary discharge (CD), a movement-command copy that is routed to sensory structures.Many different types of CD have evolved, and each is suited to the motor-induced problems faced by the organism. These differences lend themselves to a functional taxonomic classification.The CD taxonomy consists of higher- and lower-order categories that are based on the operational impact of the signal on the nervous system. Lower-order CD signalling is used for functions such as reflex inhibition and sensory filtration, whereas higher-order signalling participates in functions such as sensory analysis and stability, as well as sensorimotor planning and learning.Inhibition mediated by CD enables reflex coordination in animals such as nematodes, tadpoles and gastropods. Sensory filtration mechanisms regulate traffic through the differing sensory systems of animals such as the crayfish, the cockroach, the dogfish, the cricket, the marmoset and the macaque.CD for sensory analysis and stability enables organisms such as the macaque, the rat, the mormyrid and the bat to move and yet experience the world as it is (stable and continuous) rather than as it is sensed at the receptor level (in a chaotic and piecemeal fashion). These CDs allow brain structures to carry out appropriate adjustments in anticipation of the sensory input that results from a movement and to thus construct a stable representation of the world.CD for sensorimotor planning and learning provides internal feedback about movements that enables animals such as monkeys and birds to rapidly learn and execute sequences of motor patterns. As a result, behaviours can be prepared for the future (planning) and can be modified based on the lessons of the past (learning).As one ascends from lower-order CD through the stages of higher-order CD, the sensory target occupies increasingly higher tiers of the nervous system. This illustrates that there is no single type of CD: rather there are numerous subtypes that correspond both to anatomical levels of the source and the target and to functional utilities.Future CD studies should examine CDs at multiple resolutions, identify them in neglected sensory systems and determine the functional range of single CD circuits. The ultimate goal will be to discover how CD influences perception.},

The article reviews practical and methodological issues of the ESM and presents evidence for its short- and long-term reliability when used as an instrument for assessing the variables outlined above. It also presents evidence for validity by showing correlation between ESM measures on the one hand and physiological measures, one-time psychological tests, and behavioral indices on the other. A number of studies with normal and clinical populations that have used the ESM are reviewed to demonstrate the range of issues to which the technique can be usefully applied.},

Visibility of the screen and visibility of the keyboard were manipulated. Participants reported what type of error occurred and by which sources they detected the error.

With covered screen, the number of reported higher-order planning errors did not significantly differ between MI and ME. However, the number of reported motor command errors was lower in MI than in ME. Hence, only errors that occur in advance to internal modeling are equally observed in MI and ME. MI may require more attention than ME, leaving fewer resources to monitor motor command errors in MI. In comparison to hunt-and-peck typists, ten-finger typists detected more higher-order planning errors by kinesthesis/touch and fewer motor command errors by vision of the keyboard.

Motor imagery (MI) and brain stimulation have been showed as beneficial approaches that boost motor learning, but little is known about the extent of their combined effects. Objective Here, we aimed to investigate, for the first time, whether delivering multiple sessions of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over primary motor cortex during physical and MI practice might improve implicit motor sequence learning in a young population. Methods Participants practiced a serial reaction time task (SRTT) either physically or through MI, and concomitantly received either an anodal (excitatory) or sham stimulation over the primary motor cortex during three successive days. The effect of anodal tDCS on the general motor skill and sequence specific learning were assessed on both acquisition (within-day) and consolidation (between-day) processes. We further compared the magnitude of motor learning reached after a single and three daily sessions of tDCS. Results The main finding showed that anodal tDCS boosted MI practice, but not physical practice, during the first acquisition session. A second major result showed that compared to sham stimulation, multiple daily session of anodal tDCS, for both types of practice, resulted in greater implicit motor sequence learning rather than a single session of stimulation. Conclusions The present study is of particular importance in the context of rehabilitation, where we postulate that scheduling mental training when patients are not able to perform physical movement might beneficiate from concomitant and consecutive brain stimulation sessions over M1 to promote functional recovery.},

In the past decades, several techniques, including transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), have allowed us to gain insights into the functional role of such preparatory activity in humans. More recently, new TMS tools have been proposed to study the mechanistic principles underlying the changes in corticospinal excitability during action preparation. The aim of the present review is to provide a comprehensive description of these advanced methods and to discuss the new knowledge they give access to, relative to other existing approaches. We start with a brief synthesis of the work that has been achieved so far using classic TMS protocols during action preparation, such as the so-called single-pulse and paired-pulse techniques. We then highlight three new approaches that recently arose in the field of action preparation, including (1) the exploitation of TMS current direction, known as directional TMS, which enables investigating different subsets of neurons in the primary motor cortex, (2) the use of paired-pulse TMS to study the suppressive influence of the cerebellum on corticospinal excitability and (3) the development of a double-coil TMS approach, which facilitates the study of bilateral changes in corticospinal excitability. The aim of the present article is twofold: we seek to provide a comprehensive description of these advanced TMS tools and to discuss their bearings for the field of action preparation with respect to more traditional TMS approaches, as well as to neuroimaging techniques such as EEG or fMRI. Finally, we point out perspectives for fundamental and clinical research that arise from the combination of these methods, widening the horizon of possibilities for the investigation of the human motor system, both in health and disease.},

(p. 811; see the Perspective by Haggard) investigated the effect of direct cortical stimulation of parietal and premotor regions in patients undergoing brain surgery for tumor removal. Stimulation of the parietal lobe provoked the conscious experience of wanting to move the upper limb, lips, or tongue without any concomitant motor activity. When stimulation intensity was increased, patients believed that they had actually moved or talked, but again no muscle activity was detected. When, however, the premotor region of the frontal lobes was stimulated, real complex multijoint movements were induced. However, patients did not experience these movements as produced by a conscious internal act of will. Indeed, they were not even aware that they had moved. Increasing stimulation intensity increased the amplitude or complexity of the movement but never made it reach consciousness. Parietal and premotor cortex regions are serious contenders for bringing motor intentions and motor responses into awareness. We used electrical stimulation in seven patients undergoing awake brain surgery. Stimulating the right inferior parietal regions triggered a strong intention and desire to move the contralateral hand, arm, or foot, whereas stimulating the left inferior parietal region provoked the intention to move the lips and to talk. When stimulation intensity was increased in parietal areas, participants believed they had really performed these movements, although no electromyographic activity was detected. Stimulation of the premotor region triggered overt mouth and contralateral limb movements. Yet, patients firmly denied that they had moved. Conscious intention and motor awareness thus arise from increased parietal activity before movement execution. Stimulation of the parietal cortex causes subjects to report having moved, even in the absence of actual motor responses.

  abstract = {The study of human action stopping has been dominated by two controversial debates. First, the contributions (and neural signatures) of attentional orienting and motor inhibition to the stopping process are near-impossible to disentangle. Second, the timing of purportedly inhibitory brain activity after to stop-signals has called into question which neural signatures actually contribute to stopping. Here, we propose that a two-stage model of stopping in rodents \textendash{} proposed by Schmidt and Berke (2017) \textendash{} may resolve these controversies. In translating this model to humans, we first argue that attentional orienting and motor inhibition are inseparable because orienting (to stop-signals and other salient events) automatically invokes broad motor inhibition, reflecting a fast-acting, ubiquitous Pause process. We then argue that inhibitory signatures after stop-signals differ in latency because they map onto different phases of this two-stage model: the global Pause and a slower Cancel process, which is specific to stop-signals. We formulate the model, discuss recent supporting evidence in humans, and interpret existing data within its context.},

  abstract = {Movements that are executed or imagined activate a similar subset of cortical regions, but the extent to which this activity represents functionally equivalent neural processes is unclear. During preparation for an executed movement, presentation of a startling acoustic stimulus (SAS) evokes a premature release of the planned movement with the spatial and temporal features of the tasks essentially intact. If imagined movement incorporates the same preparatory processes as executed movement, then a SAS should release the planned movement during preparation. This hypothesis was tested using an instructed-delay cueing paradigm during which subjects were required to rapidly release a handheld weight while maintaining the posture of the arm or to perform first-person imagery of the same task while holding the weight. In a subset of trials, a SAS was presented at 1500, 500, or 200~ms prior to the release cue. Task-appropriate preparation during executed and imagined movements was confirmed by electroencephalographic recording of a contingent negative variation waveform. During preparation for executed movement, a SAS often resulted in premature release of the weight with the probability of release progressively increasing from 24~\% at -1500~ms to 80~\% at -200~ms. In contrast, the SAS rarely ({$<$}2~\% of trials) triggered a release of the weight during imagined movement. However, the SAS frequently evoked the planned postural response (suppression of bicep brachii muscle activity) irrespective of the task or timing of stimulation (even during periods of postural hold without preparation). These findings provide evidence that neural processes mediating the preparation and release of the focal motor task (release of the weight) are markedly attenuated or absent during imagined movement and that postural and focal components of the task are prepared independently.},

An alternative view is that, crucial for speech perception, it is the activation of the articulatory (motor) gestures that generate these sounds. The listener understands the speaker when his/her articulatory gestures are activated (motor theory of speech perception). Here, by using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), we demonstrate that, during speech listening, there is an increase of motor-evoked potentials recorded from the listeners' tongue muscles when the presented words strongly involve, when pronounced, tongue movements. Although these data do not prove the motor theory of speech perception, they demonstrate for the first time that word listening produces a phoneme specific activation of speech motor centres.},

Two alternative models of the development of AVHs in both normal and psychotic populations are proposed. In the disruption to internalisation (DI) model, AVHs result from a disruption to the normal processes of internalisation of inner speech. In the re-expansion (RE) model, AVHs result when normal inner speech is re-expanded into inner dialogue under conditions of stress and cognitive challenge. Both models draw on Vygotsky's (The Collected Works Of L.S. Vygotsky, New York, Plenum Press, 1987) ideas about the development of inner speech. On this view, normal inner speech is considerably abbreviated relative to external speech, and also undergoes some important semantic transformations. In both the DI and RE models, AVHs arise when the subject's inner speech involves inappropriately expanded inner dialogue, leading the subject to experience the voices in the dialogue as alien. The two models may prove useful in explaining some of the social-developmental evidence surrounding the phenomenon, and also make a number of testable predictions which are suggested as priorities for future research.},

In this study, subdural electrode grids were placed on the medial surface of the cerebral hemispheres in 13 patients with intractable epilepsy undergoing evaluation for surgical treatment. Electrical stimulation mapping with currents below the threshold of afterdischarges showed somatotopic organization of supplementary motor cortex with the lower extremities represented posteriorly, head and face most anteriorly, and the upper extremities between these two regions. Electrical stimulation often elicited synergistic and complex movements involving more than one joint. In transitional areas between neighboring somatotopic representations, stimulation evoked combined movements involving the body parts represented in these adjacent regions. Anterior to the supplementary motor representation of the face, vocalization and speech arrest or slowing of speech were evoked. Various sensations were elicited by electrical stimulation of SMA. In some cases a preliminary sensation of ``urge'' to perform a movement or anticipation that a movement was about to occur were evoked. Most responses were contralateral to the stimulated hemisphere. Ipsilateral and bilateral responses were elicited almost exclusively from the right (nondominant) hemisphere. These data suggest the presence of combined somatotopic organization and left-right specialization in human supplementary motor cortex.},

An experiment reported here suggests that this view is not tenable and that, on the contrary, the results provide evidence for immediate lexical identification. Another experiment on reading misspelled and graphically distorted text also provides evidence against prior phonological encoding. It was more difficult to read text that preserved only the sound than text that preserved only the visual outline of the original words. This was true even for very young readers. It is likely that sound in reading plays a secondary role. The role of sound in writing, however, appears to be primary and dominant. Most spelling errors and unintentional slips of the pen show letter patterns that sound like the target word. Some experiments are discussed that show that the same person may read ``by eye'' and write ``by ear.'' In particular there is a group of people who are good readers and poor spellers and are unable to coordinate these two strategies. Hence, it is necessary to consider language reception, as in reading, and language production, as in writing, to be two separate, specialised skills. How closely can we equate spoken and written language? Is reading just a form of listening and writing just a form of speaking? It would be simpler to understand both language systems in terms of the same processes. Also, it seems likely that handling visible language would benefit from the well rehearsed processes that have been established previously for handling spoken language. Given this rationale, it is plausible to assume that the way we recognise written words is first to translate them into sound, then to treat the resulting sounds as if they were heard speech. However, rather than assuming that reading is parasitic on listening, it might be assumed that listening to speech and silently reading prose share the same process for understanding.},

Some previous behavioral studies found deficiencies in inhibitory motor control in Tourette syndrome, but others suggested normal or even better-than-normal performance. Furthermore, neural correlates of action inhibition in these patients are poorly understood. We performed event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging during a stop-signal reaction-time task in 14 uncomplicated adult Tourette patients and 15 healthy controls. In patients, we correlated activations in stop-signal reaction-time task with their individual motor tic frequency. Task performance was similar in both groups. Activation of dorsal premotor cortex was stronger in the StopSuccess than in the Go condition in healthy controls. This pattern was reversed in Tourette patients. A significant positive correlation was present between motor tic frequency and activations in the supplementary motor area during StopSuccess versus Go in patients. Inhibitory brain networks differ between healthy controls and Tourette patients. In the latter the supplementary motor area is probably a key relay of inhibitory processes mediating both suppression of tics and inhibition of voluntary action.},

According to this view, engaging executive resources with an interference task during motor imagery or overt actions will lead to a greater lengthening of the time required to imagine a movement than to execute it physically. This model is in contrast to a currently popular view, the functional equivalence model, which holds that motor imagery and overt action use identical mental processes, and thus should be equally affected by task manipulations. The two competing frameworks were tested in three experiments that varied the amount and type of executive resources needed to perform an interference task concurrent with either an overt or imagined version of a grasping and placing action. In Experiment 1, performing a concurrent calculation task led to a greater lengthening of the time required to execute motor imagery than overt action relative to a control condition involving no interference task. Further, an increase in the number of responses used to index performance affected the timing of motor imagery but not overt actions. In Experiment 2, a low-load repetition task interfered with the timing of motor imagery, but less so than a high load calculation task; both tasks had much smaller effects on overt actions. In Experiment 3, a word generation task also interfered with motor imagery much more than with overt actions. The results of these experiments provide broad support for the motor-cognitive model over the functional equivalence model in showing that interfering with executive functions had a much greater impact on the timing of motor imagery than on overt actions. The possible roles of different executive processes in motor imagery are discussed.},

  abstract = {Inner speech has been shown to vary in form along several dimensions. Along condensation, condensed inner speech forms have been described, that are supposed to be deprived of acoustic, phonological and even syntactic qualities. Expanded forms, on the other extreme, display articulatory and auditory properties. Along dialogality, inner speech can be monologal, when we engage in internal soliloquy, or dialogal, when we recall past conversations or imagine future dialogues involving our own voice as well as that of others addressing us. Along intentionality, it can be intentional (when we deliberately rehearse material in short-term memory) or it can arise unintentionally (during mind wandering). We introduce the ConDialInt model, a neurocognitive predictive control model of inner speech that accounts for its varieties along these three dimensions. ConDialInt spells out the condensation dimension by including inhibitory control at the conceptualization, formulation or articulatory planning stage. It accounts for dialogality, by assuming internal model adaptations and by speculating on neural processes underlying perspective switching. It explains the differences between intentional and spontaneous varieties in terms of monitoring. We present an fMRI study in which we probed varieties of inner speech along dialogality and intentionality, to examine the validity of the neuroanatomical correlates posited in ConDialInt. Condensation was also informally tackled. Our data support the hypothesis that expanded inner speech recruits speech production processes down to articulatory planning, resulting in a predicted signal, the inner voice, with auditory qualities. Along dialogality, covertly using an avatar's voice resulted in the activation of right hemisphere homologues of the regions involved in internal own-voice soliloquy and in cerebellar deactivation, consistent with internal model adaptation. Switching from first-person to third-person perspective resulted in activations in precuneus and parietal lobules. Along intentionality, compared with intentional inner speech, mind wandering with inner speech episodes was associated with greater bilateral inferior frontal activation and decreased activation in left temporal regions. This is consistent with the reported subjective evanescence and presumably reflects condensation processes. Our results provide neuroanatomical evidence compatible with predictive control and in favor of the assumptions made in the ConDialInt model.},

  abstract = {The emulation theory of representation is developed and explored as a framework that can revealingly synthesize a wide variety of representational functions of the brain. The framework is based on constructs from control theory (forward models) and signal processing (Kalman filters). The idea is that in addition to simply engaging with the body and environment, the brain constructs neural circuits that act as models of the body and environment. During overt sensorimotor engagement, these models are driven by efference copies in parallel with the body and environment, in order to provide expectations of the sensory feedback, and to enhance and process sensory information. These models can also be run off-line in order to produce imagery, estimate outcomes of different actions, and evaluate and develop motor plans. The framework is initially developed within the context of motor control, where it has been shown that inner models running in parallel with the body can reduce the effects of feedback delay problems. The same mechanisms can account for motor imagery as the off-line driving of the emulator via efference copies. The framework is extended to account for visual imagery as the off-line driving of an emulator of the motor-visual loop. I also show how such systems can provide for amodal spatial imagery.

Arguably, one of the major factors behind this success has been the availability of high quality parallel corpora. In this work, we investigate how to leverage abundant monolingual corpora for neural machine translation. Compared to a phrase-based and hierarchical baseline, we obtain up to \$1.96\$ BLEU improvement on the low-resource language pair Turkish-English, and \$1.59\$ BLEU on the focused domain task of Chinese-English chat messages. While our method was initially targeted toward such tasks with less parallel data, we show that it also extends to high resource languages such as Cs-En and De-En where we obtain an improvement of \$0.39\$ and \$0.47\$ BLEU scores over the neural machine translation baselines, respectively.},

  abstract = {The increase in spatiotemporal resolution of neuroimaging devices is accompanied by a trend towards more powerful multivariate analysis methods. Often it is desired to interpret the outcome of these methods with respect to the cognitive processes under study. Here we discuss which methods allow for such interpretations, and provide guidelines for choosing an appropriate analysis for a given experimental goal: For a surgeon who needs to decide where to remove brain tissue it is most important to determine the origin of cognitive functions and associated neural processes. In contrast, when communicating with paralyzed or comatose patients via brain\textendash computer interfaces, it is most important to accurately extract the neural processes specific to a certain mental state. These equally important but complementary objectives require different analysis methods. Determining the origin of neural processes in time or space from the parameters of a data-driven model requires what we call a forward model of the data; such a model explains how the measured data was generated from the neural sources. Examples are general linear models (GLMs). Methods for the extraction of neural information from data can be considered as backward models, as they attempt to reverse the data generating process. Examples are multivariate classifiers. Here we demonstrate that the parameters of forward models are neurophysiologically interpretable in the sense that significant nonzero weights are only observed at channels the activity of which is related to the brain process under study. In contrast, the interpretation of backward model parameters can lead to wrong conclusions regarding the spatial or temporal origin of the neural signals of interest, since significant nonzero weights may also be observed at channels the activity of which is statistically independent of the brain process under study. As a remedy for the linear case, we propose a procedure for transforming backward models into forward models. This procedure enables the neurophysiological interpretation of the parameters of linear backward models. We hope that this work raises awareness for an often encountered problem and provides a theoretical basis for conducting better interpretable multivariate neuroimaging analyses.},

In an MRI scanner, five participants performed tasks designed to elicit inner speech (covertly repeating experimenter-supplied words), inner seeing, inner hearing, feeling, and sensing. Then, in their natural environments, participants were trained in four days of random-beep-triggered Descriptive Experience Sampling (DES). They subsequently returned to the scanner for nine 25-min resting-state sessions; during each they received four DES beeps and described those moments (9 \texttimes{} 4 = 36 moments per participant) of spontaneously occurring experience. Enough of those moments included spontaneous inner speech to allow us to compare brain activation during spontaneous inner speech with what we had found in task-elicited inner speech. ROI analysis was used to compare activation in two relevant areas (Heschl's gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus). Task-elicited inner speech was associated with decreased activation in Heschl's gyrus and increased activation in left inferior frontal gyrus. However, spontaneous inner speech had the opposite effect in Heschl's gyrus and no significant effect in left inferior frontal gyrus. This study demonstrates how spontaneous phenomena can be investigated in MRI and calls into question the assumption that task-created phenomena are often neurophysiologically and psychologically similar to spontaneously occurring phenomena.},

Based on our studies of inner experience using Descriptive Experience Sampling (a qualitative method designed to produce high fidelity descriptions of randomly selected pristine inner experience), we advance an initial phenomenology of inner speaking. Inner speaking does occur in many, though certainly not all, moments of pristine inner experience. Most commonly it is experienced by the person as speaking in his or her own naturally inflected voice but with no sound being produced. In addition to prototypical instances of inner speaking, there are wide-ranging variations that fit the broad category of inner speaking and large individual differences in the frequency with which individuals experience inner speaking. Our observations are discrepant from what many have said about inner speaking, which we attribute to the characteristics of the methods different researchers have used to examine inner speaking. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

TS is associated with impairments in behavioral inhibition, dysfunctional signaling of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, and alterations in the balance of excitatory and inhibitory influences within brain networks implicated in motor learning and the selection of actions. We review evidence that increased control over motor outputs, including the suppression of tics, may develop during adolescence in TS and be accompanied by compensatory, neuromodulatory, alterations in brain structure and function. In particular, we argue that increased control over motor outputs in TS is brought about by local increases in `tonic' inhibition that lead to a reduction in the `gain' of motor excitability.},

Action planning and motor preparation can be studied using a specific type of representational activity, motor imagery. A close functional equivalence between motor imagery and motor preparation is suggested by the positive effects of imagining movements on motor learning, the similarity between the neural structures involved, and the similar physiological correlates observed in both imaging and preparing. The content of motor representations can be inferred from motor images at a macroscopic level, based on global aspects of the action (the duration and amount of effort involved) and the motor rules and constraints which predict the spatial path and kinematics of movements. A more microscopic neural account calls for a representation of object-oriented action. Object attributes are processed in different neural pathways depending on the kind of task the subject is performing. During object-oriented action, a pragmatic representation is activated in which object affordances are transformed into specific motor schemas (independently of other tasks such as object recognition). Animal as.svell as human clinical data implicate the posterior parietal and premotor cortical areas in schema instantiation. A mechanism is proposed that is able to encode the desired goal of the action and is applicable to different levels of representational organization.},

Finally, for departures in orientation from the upright between 0\textdegree{} and 120\textdegree, the magnitude of the orientation effect on identification for patterns seen for the first time is equivalent to that found in a mental rotation task using the same patterns (making left/right decisions about rotated patterns).

  abstract = {What might a theory of mental imagery look like, and how might one begin formulating such a theory? These are the central questions addressed in the present paper. The first section outlines the general research direction taken here and provides an overview of the empirical foundations of our theory of image representation and processing. Four issues are considered in succession, and the relevant results of experiments are presented and discussed. The second section begins with a discussion of the proper form for a cognitive theory, and the distinction between a theory and a model is developed. Following this, the present theory and computer simulation model are introduced. This theory specifies the nature of the internal representations (data structures) and the processes that operate on them when one generates, inspects, or transforms mental images. In the third, concluding, section we consider three very different kinds of objections to the present research program, one hinging on the possibility of experimental artifacts in the data, and the others turning on metatheoretical commitments about the form of a cognitive theory. Finally, we discuss how one ought best to evaluate theories and models of the sort developed here.},

The current practice of individualized motor imagery practice schemes often lacks systematization and is mostly based on experience. We review literature related to motor imagery practice in order to identify relevant modulators of practice effects like previous experience in motor training and motor imagery practice, the type of motor task to be trained, and strategies to increase sensory feedback during physical practice. Relevant discrepancies are identified between neuroscientific findings and practical consideration of these findings. To bridge these gaps, more effort should be directed at analyzing the brain network activities related to practically relevant motor imagery practice interventions.},

We observe that standard performance evaluation metrics can be oblivious to distinguishing these diverse problem solving behaviors. Furthermore, we propose our semi-automated Spectral Relevance Analysis that provides a practically effective way of characterizing and validating the behavior of nonlinear learning machines. This helps to assess whether a learned model indeed delivers reliably for the problem that it was conceived for.

They performed MI (right index-thumb pinching in time with a 1 Hz metronome) or hand MR tasks, while motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from right first dorsal interosseous. At rest, rIPL conditioning 6 ms prior to M1 stimulation facilitated MEPs in all participants, whereas this facilitation was abolished during MR. While rIPL conditioning 12 ms prior to M1 stimulation had no effect on MEPs at rest, it suppressed corticomotor excitability during MI. These results support the idea that rIPL forms part of a distinct inhibitory network that may prevent unwanted movement during imagery tasks.},

Evidence for a link between changes in inhibitory functions and poor motor performance in healthy older adults has recently become available with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Overall, these studies indicate that the capacity to modulate intracortical (ICI) and interhemispheric (IHI) inhibition is preserved in high-performing older individuals. In contrast, older individuals exhibiting motor slowing and a declined ability to coordinate movement appear to show a reduced capability to modulate GABA-mediated inhibitory processes. As a decline in the integrity of the GABA-ergic inhibitory processes may emerge due to age-related loss of white and gray matter, a promising direction for future research would be to correlate individual differences in structural and/or functional integrity of principal brain networks with observed changes in inhibitory processes within cortico-cortical, interhemispheric, and/or corticospinal pathways. Finally, we underscore the possible links between reduced inhibitory functions and age-related changes in brain activation patterns.},

For example, during actions, a copy of motor signals\textemdash termed ``corollary discharge'' (CD) or ``efference copy'' (EC)\textemdash can be transmitted to sensory regions and modulate perception. However, the sole inhibitory function of the motor copies is challenged by mixed empirical observations as well as multifaceted computational demands for behaviors. We hypothesized that the content in the motor signals available at distinct stages of actions determined the nature of signals (CD vs. EC) and constrained their modulatory functions on perceptual processing. We tested this hypothesis using speech in which we could precisely control and quantify the course of action. In three electroencephalography (EEG) experiments using a novel delayed articulation paradigm, we found that preparation without linguistic contents suppressed auditory responses to all speech sounds, whereas preparing to speak a syllable selectively enhanced the auditory responses to the prepared syllable. A computational model demonstrated that a bifurcation of motor signals could be a potential algorithm and neural implementation to achieve the distinct functions in the motor-to-sensory transformation. These results suggest that distinct motor signals are generated in the motor-to-sensory transformation and integrated with sensory input to modulate perception.},

We hypothesize that the function of the LIFG may be the monitoring of action, a function well adapted to agent deixis (verbal pointing at the agent of an action). The aim of this fMRI study was therefore to test the hypothesis that the LIFG is involved during the production of agent deixis. We performed an experiment, whereby three kinds of deictic sentences were pronounced, involving prosodic focus, syntactic extraction and prosodic focus with syntactic extraction. A common pattern of activation was found for the three deixis conditions in the LIFG (BA 45 and/or 47), the left insula and the bilateral premotor (BA 6) cortex. Prosodic deixis additionally activated the left anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 24, 32), the left supramarginal gyrus (LSMG, BA 40) and Wernicke's area (BA 22). Our results suggest that the LIFG is involved during agent deixis, through either prosody or syntax, and that the LSMG and Wernicke's area are additionally required in prosody-driven deixis. Once grammaticalized, deixis would be handled solely by the LIFG, without the LSMG and Wernicke's area.},

In Parkinson's disease, subthalamic deep brain stimulation improves movement initiation and velocity, but its effect on stopping of ongoing movement is unknown. Here, we examine the relation between movement stopping and connectivity of stimulation volumes to the stopping network. Stop and go times were collected in 17 patients with Parkinson's disease on and off subthalamic stimulation during visually cued initiation and termination of continuous, rotational movements. Deep brain stimulation contacts were localized; the stimulation volume computed and connectivity profiles estimated using an openly available, normative structural connectome. Subthalamic stimulation significantly increased stop times, which correlated with the connectivity of the stimulation volume to presupplementary motor area and inferior frontal gyrus of the right hemisphere. The robustness of this finding was validated using three separate analysis streams: voxel-wise whole-brain connectivity, region of interest connectivity and a tract-centred method. Our study sheds light on the role of the fronto-subthalamic inhibitory triangle in stopping of ongoing movements and may inspire circuit based adaptive stimulation strategies for control of stopping impairment, possibly reflected in stimulation-induced dyskinesia.},

Our previous study found that imagined speaking and imagined hearing modulated perceptual neural responses in opposite directions, suggesting motor-to-sensory transformation and memory retrieval as two separate routes that induce auditory representation (Tian \&amp; Poeppel, J Cogn Neurosci. 2013 25:1020-36). We hypothesized that the precision of representation induced from different types of speech imagery led to different modulation effects. Specifically, we predicted that the one-to-one mapping between motor and sensory domains established during speech production would evoke a more precise auditory representation in imagined speaking than retrieving the same sounds from memory in imagined hearing. To test this hypothesis, we built the function of representational precision as the modulation of connection strength in a neural network model. The model fitted the MEG imagery repetition effects, and the best-fitting parameters showed sharper tuning after imagined speaking than imagined hearing, consistent with the representational precision hypothesis. Moreover, this model predicted that different types of speech imagery would affect perception differently. In an imagery-adaptation experiment, the categorization of/ba/-/da/continuum from male and female human participants showed more positive shifts towards the preceding imagined syllable after imagined speaking than imagined hearing. These consistent simulation and behavioral results support our hypothesis that distinct mechanisms of speech imagery construct auditory representation with varying degrees of precision and differentially influence auditory perception. This study provides a mechanistic connection between neural-level activity and psychophysics that reveals the neural computation of mental imagery.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}\textbf{Significance Statement} Our brain processes sensory information that we receive from the environment and mediates mental activity such as imagination. How do mental and perceptual processes interact to shape our cognition?

This model further predicted a choice shift in perceptual responses to ambiguous auditory stimuli, which was confirmed in a follow-up imagery-adaptation experiment.

However, the precise cortical mechanisms subserving motor imagery are poorly understood. For instance, it is unclear to which extent articulatory motor cortex is involved during motor imagery of speech. We investigated the involvement of motor cortex during articulatory motor imagery through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to determine its contribution to motor imagery processing. We collected motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) to assess motor cortex excitability in three conditions: speech motor imagery, auditory speech perception, and baseline (no action). MEPs were collected at two time points after trial onset (200ms and 500ms), to measure the relative engagement of tongue primary motor cortex. The results showed that MEPs were larger for the motor imagery than for the baseline condition at 500ms post trial onset only, with no differences between the auditory speech perception and baseline conditions. These results suggest greater facilitation of tongue motor cortex during motor imagery of speech compared to rest, supporting the idea that motor cortex is engaged in motor simulation of complex speech actions.},

  abstract = {Motor imagery refers to the phenomenon of imagining performing an action without action execution. Motor imagery and motor execution are assumed to share a similar underlying neural system that involves primary motor cortex (M1). Previous studies have focused on motor imagery of manual actions, but articulatory motor imagery has not been investigated. In this study, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to elicit motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) from the articulatory muscles (orbicularis oris) as well as from hand muscles (first dorsal interosseous). Twenty participants were asked to execute or imagine performing a simple squeezing task involving a pair of tweezers, which was comparable across both effectors. MEPs were elicited at six timepoints (50, 150, 250, 350, 450, 550ms post-stimulus) to track the time-course of M1 involvement in both lip and hand tasks. The results showed increased MEP amplitudes for action execution compared to rest for both effectors at time points 350, 450 and 550ms, but we found no evidence of increased cortical activation for motor imagery. The results indicate that motor imagery does not involve M1 for simple tasks for manual or articulatory muscles. The results have implications for models of mental imagery of simple articulatory gestures, in that no evidence is found for somatotopic activation of lip muscles in sub-phonemic contexts during motor imagery of such tasks, suggesting that motor simulation of relatively simple actions does not involve M1.},

We used a startling acoustic stimulus (SAS), which has been shown to trigger prepared movements involuntarily at short latencies via an increase in cortical activation, to probe the similarity of these processes and elicit movement responses in imagery and observation trials. Startle trials were interspersed with control trials while participants (n=16) performed or imagined a right hand key lift or observed a model perform the key lift. During physical movement trials, intended movements were triggered by the SAS at a short latency (RT=78ms) in comparison to control trials (RT=110ms). During imagery and observation, unimanual partial movements (assessed by force change and muscle activation) were elicited by the SAS, providing novel behavioural evidence for a functional similarity between covert and overt movement preparation processes. Examination of the magnitude of the reflexive startle response (an index of motor preparation) during imagery and observation also revealed similarities to physical movement trials. We conclude that covert and overt movements involve similarities in motor preparation and neural pathways, and propose that movements do not normally occur during imagery and observation due to low level neural activation.},

In two recent publications, we have shown that mental imagery can lead to perceptual learning (Tartaglia et al., , ). Observers imagined the central line of a bisection stimulus for thousands of trials. This training enabled observers to perceive bisection offsets that were invisible before training. Hence, it seems that perceptual learning via mental imagery leads to new percepts. We will argue, however, that these new percepts can occur only within ``known'' models. In this sense, perceptual learning via mental imagery exceeds new discoveries in mental images. Still, the effects of mental imagery on perceptual learning are limited. Only perception can lead to really new perceptual experience.},

  abstract = {Recent decades have seen a move towards evidence-based medicine to inform the clinical decision-making process with reproducible findings from high-quality research studies. There is a need for objective, quantitative measurement tools to increase the reliability and reproducibility of studies evaluating the efficacy of healthcare interventions, particularly in the field of physical and rehabilitative medicine. Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a non-invasive measure of muscle activity that is widely used in research but is under-utilized as a clinical tool in rehabilitative medicine. Other types of electrophysiological signals (e.g. electrocardiography, electroencephalography, intramuscular EMG) are commonly recorded by healthcare practitioners, however, sEMG has yet to successfully transition to clinical practice. Surface EMG has clear clinical potential as an indicator of muscle activation, however reliable extraction of information requires knowledge of the appropriate methods for recording and analyzing sEMG and an understanding of the underlying biophysics. These concepts are generally not covered in sufficient depth in the standard curriculum for physiotherapists and kinesiologists to encourage a confident use of sEMG in clinical practice. In addition, the common perception of sEMG as a specialized topic means that the clinical potential of sEMG and the pathways to application in practice are often not apparent. The aim of this paper is to address barriers to the translation of sEMG by emphasizing its benefits as an objective clinical tool and by overcoming its perceived complexity. The many useful clinical applications of sEMG are highlighted and examples provided to illustrate how it can be implemented in practice. The paper outlines how fundamental biophysics and EMG signal processing concepts could be presented to a non-technical audience. An accompanying tutorial with sample data and code is provided which could be used as a tool for teaching or self-guided learning. The importance of observing sEMG in routine use in clinic is identified as an essential part of the effective communication of sEMG recording and signal analysis methods. Highlighting the advantages of sEMG as a clinical tool and reducing its perceived complexity could bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application and provide the impetus for the widespread use of sEMG in clinic.},

Stated broadly, data modelers use simple, interpretable models with well-understood theoretical properties to analyze data. Algorithmic modelers prioritize predictive accuracy and use more flexible function approximations to analyze data. This dichotomy overlooks a third set of models \$-\$ mechanistic models derived from scientific theories (e.g., ODE/SDE simulators). Mechanistic models encode application-specific scientific knowledge about the data. And while these categories represent extreme points in model space, modern computational and algorithmic tools enable us to interpolate between these points, producing flexible, interpretable, and scientifically-informed hybrids that can enjoy accurate and robust predictions, and resolve issues with data analysis that Breiman describes, such as the Rashomon effect and Occam's dilemma. Challenges still remain in finding an appropriate point in model space, with many choices on how to compose model components and the degree to which each component informs inferences.},

Recent evidence suggests that STN can also cancel an already selected action when goals change, a key aspect of cognitive control. However, there is little neurophysiological evidence for dissociation between selecting and cancelling actions in the human STN. We recorded single neurons in the STN of humans performing a stop-signal task. Movement-related neurons suppressed their activity during successful stopping, whereas stop-signal neurons activated at low-latencies near the stop-signal reaction time. In contrast, STN and motor-cortical beta-bursting occurred only later in the stopping process. Task-related neuronal properties varied by recording location from dorsolateral movement to ventromedial stop-signal tuning. Therefore, action selection and cancellation coexist in STN but are anatomically segregated. These results show that human ventromedial STN neurons carry fast stop-related signals suitable for implementing cognitive control.},

  abstract = {Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has proven to be a useful tool in investigating the role of the articulatory motor cortex in speech perception. Researchers have used single-pulse and repetitive TMS to stimulate the lip representation in the motor cortex. The excitability of the lip motor representation can be investigated by applying single TMS pulses over this cortical area and recording TMS-induced motor evoked potentials (MEPs) via electrodes attached to the lip muscles (electromyography; EMG). Larger MEPs reflect increased cortical excitability. Studies have shown that excitability increases during listening to speech as well as during viewing speech-related movements. TMS can be used also to disrupt the lip motor representation. A 15-min train of low-frequency sub-threshold repetitive stimulation has been shown to suppress motor excitability for a further 15-20 min. This TMS-induced disruption of the motor lip representation impairs subsequent performance in demanding speech perception tasks and modulates auditory-cortex responses to speech sounds. These findings are consistent with the suggestion that the motor cortex contributes to speech perception. This article describes how to localize the lip representation in the motor cortex and how to define the appropriate stimulation intensity for carrying out both single-pulse and repetitive TMS experiments.},

Buchanan, 1975) appeared to support the phonological-loop model, but subsequent researchers have obtained conflicting data that putatively disconfirm its assumptions.

The question of whether a totally novel movement may be learned by mental practice was investigated. Healthy young adults had to learn the abduction of the big toe (dominant right foot) without moving the other toes or the foot. The subjects were divided into two groups: subjects who were absolutely unable to abduct their big toe ("absolute zero" group) and subjects who were able to abduct their toe to some extent but showed clear room for improvement ("already doing it" group). Two separate experiments were executed. In the first experiment, 37 absolute-zero subjects had to practice, mentally or physically, the target movement. In the second experiment 40 already-doing-it subjects had to improve their toeabduction skill. The results showed that absolute-zero subjects could not acquire the toe-abduction movement by means of mental practice. Only subjects who physically practiced the target movement improved significantly. Subjects who had some experience in the task (alreadydoing-it subjects) improved significantly after mental practice as well as after physical practice. The results seem to indicate that it is more plausible to explain the learning effects of mental practice in terms of a top-down mechanism based on the activation of a central representation of the movement than in terms of a peripheral bottomup mechanism based on the activation of muscles.},

Inhibition of some subcortical regions takes a directed global form, with prefrontal regions providing contextual information relevant to when to inhibit all processing in a region. Inhibition within neocortical (and some subcortical) regions takes an indirect competitive form, with prefrontal regions providing excitation of goal-relevant options.

The simulation hypothesis postulates that inner speech is a simulation of overt speech, and would as such involve the motor system. If so, we could expect verbal rumination --as a particular kind of inner speech-- to be disrupted by concurrent involvement of the speech muscles. We recruited 106 healthy adults and measured their self-reported level of rumination before and after a rumination induction, as well as after five minutes of a subsequent motor task (either an articulatory suppression -silent mouthing- task or a finger tapping control task). We also evaluated to what extent ruminative thoughts were experienced with a verbal quality or in another modality (e.g., visual images, non-speech sounds). Self-reported levels of rumination showed a decrease after both motor activities (silent mouthing and finger-tapping), with only a slightly stronger decrease after the articulatory suppression than the control task. The rumination level decrease was not moderated by the modality of the ruminative thoughts. We discuss these results within the framework of verbal rumination as simulated speech and suggest alternative ways to test the engagement of the speech motor system in verbal rumination.

An automatic classification approach was undertaken to discriminate between two articulatory features contained in nonwords uttered in both overt and covert speech. Although this approach led to reasonable accuracy rates during overt speech production, it failed to discriminate inner speech phonetic content based on surface electromyography signals. However, exploratory analyses conducted at the individual level revealed that it seemed possible to distinguish between rounded and spread nonwords covertly produced, in two participants.

  abstract = {Previous research showed that mental rumination, considered as a form of repetitive and negative inner speech, is associated with increased facial muscular activity. However, the relation between these muscular activations and the underlying mental processes is still unclear. In this study, we tried to separate the facial electromyographic correlates of induced rumination related to either i) mechanisms of (inner) speech production or ii) rumination as a state of pondering on negative affects. To this end, we compared two groups of participants submitted to two types of rumination induction (for a total of 85 female undergraduate students without excessive depressive symptoms). The first type of induction was designed to specifically induce rumination in a verbal modality whereas the second one was designed to induce rumination in a visual modality. Following the motor simulation view of inner speech production, we hypothesised that the verbal rumination induction should result in a higher increase of activity in the speech-related muscles as compared to the non-verbal rumination induction. We also hypothesised that relaxation focused on the orofacial area should be more efficient in reducing rumination (when experienced in a verbal modality) than a relaxation focused on a non-orofacial area. Our results do not corroborate these hypotheses, as both rumination inductions resulted in a similar increase of peripheral muscular activity in comparison to baseline levels. Moreover, the two relaxation types were similarly efficient in reducing rumination, whatever the rumination induction. We discuss these results in relation to the inner speech literature and suggest that because rumination is a habitual and automatic form of emotion regulation, it might be a particularly (strongly) internalised and condensed form of inner speech.

This paper introduces Bayesian multilevel modelling for the specific analysis of speech data, using the brms package developed in R. Method: In this tutorial, we provide a practical introduction to Bayesian multilevel modelling, by reanalysing a phonetic dataset containing formant (F1 and F2) values for five vowels of Standard Indonesian (ISO 639-3:ind), as spoken by eight speakers (four females), with several repetitions of each vowel. Results: We first give an introductory overview of the Bayesian framework and multilevel modelling. We then show how Bayesian multilevel models can be fitted using the probabilistic programming language Stan and the R package brms, which provides an intuitive formula syntax. Conclusions: Through this tutorial, we demonstrate some of the advantages of the Bayesian framework for statistical modelling and provide a detailed case study, with complete source code for full reproducibility of the analyses (https://osf.io/dpzcb/).},

Based on the absence of significant difference in the perioral muscular activity between the rumination and distraction conditions, Moffatt et al. (2020) concluded that self-reported inner experience was unrelated to peripheral muscular activity as assessed using surface electromyography. We suggest this conclusion is at best hasty. Indeed, concluding on the absence of an effect based on an under-powered non-significant p-value is strongly uninformative. Moreover, the relation between self-reports and physiological measures was not directly assessed, but only indirectly inferred from differences (or absence thereof) in group averages. Given the ample inter-individual variability in these measures (as suggested by our reanalysis), we think inferring the individual-level relation between self-reports and physiological measures from group averages is inappropriate. Given these limitations, we conclude that there is limited evidence for the main conclusion put forward by Moffatt et al.

  abstract = {Rumination is known to be a predominantly verbal process and has been proposed to be considered as such as a dysfunctional form of inner speech (i.e., the silent production of words in one's mind). On the other hand, research on the psychophysiology of inner speech revealed that the neural processes involved in overt and covert speech tend to be very similar. This is coherent with the idea that some forms of inner speech could be considered as a kind of simulation of overt speech, in the same way as imagined actions can be considered as the result of a simulation of the corresponding overt action (e.g., walking and imagined walking). In other words, the motor simulation hypothesis suggests that the speech motor system should be involved as well during inner speech production. The corollary hypothesis might be drawn, according to which the production of inner speech (and rumination) should be disrupted by a disruption of the speech motor system. We conducted a series of five studies aiming to probe the role of the speech motor system in rumination. Overall, our results highlight that although verbal rumination may be considered as a form of inner speech, it might not specifically involve the speech motor system. More precisely, we argue that rumination might be considered as a particularly strongly condensed form of inner speech that does not systematically involve fully specified articulatory features. We discuss these findings in relation to the habit-goal framework of depressive rumination and we discuss the implications of these findings for theories of inner speech production.},

By means of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), few studies revealed a decrease of short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) within the primary motor cortex. However, this decrease is ambiguous, as one would expect greater inhibition during MI to prevent overt motor output. The current study investigated the extent of SICI modulation during MI through a methodological and a conceptual reconsideration of (i) the importance of parameters to assess SICI (Exp.1) and (ii) the inhibitory process within the primary motor cortex as an inherent feature of MI (Exp.2). Participants performed two tasks: (1) rest and (2) imagery of isometric abduction of the right index finger. Using TMS, motor evoked potentials were elicited in the right first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle. An adaptive threshold-hunting paradigm was used, where the stimulus intensity required to maintain a fixed motor evoked potential amplitude was quantified. To test SICI, we conditioned the test stimulus with a conditioning stimulus (CS) of different intensities. Results revealed an Intensity by Task interaction showing that SICI decreased during MI as compared to rest only for the higher CS intensity (Exp.1). At the lowest CS intensities, a Task main effect revealed that SICI increased during MI (Exp.2). SICI modulation during MI depends critically on the CS intensity. By optimising CS intensity, we have shown that SICI circuits may increase during MI, revealing a potential mechanism to prevent the production of a movement while the motor system is activated.},

  abstract = {The basal ganglia (BG) are a highly organized network, where different parts are activated for specific functions and circumstances. The BG are involved in movement control, as well as associative learning, planning, working memory, and emotion. We concentrate on the "motor circuit" because it is the best understood anatomically and physiologically, and because Parkinson's disease is mainly thought to be a movement disorder. Normal function of the BG requires fine tuning of neuronal excitability within each nucleus to determine the exact degree of movement facilitation or inhibition at any given moment. This is mediated by the complex organization of the striatum, where the excitability of medium spiny neurons is controlled by several pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms as well as interneuron activity, and secured by several recurrent or internal BG circuits. The motor circuit of the BG has two entry points, the striatum and the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and an output, the globus pallidus pars interna (GPi), which connects to the cortex via the motor thalamus. Neuronal afferents coding for a given movement or task project to the BG by two different systems: (1) Direct disynaptic projections to the GPi via the striatum and STN. (2) Indirect trisynaptic projections to the GPi via the globus pallidus pars externa (GPe). Corticostriatal afferents primarily act to inhibit medium spiny neurons in the "indirect circuit" and facilitate neurons in the "direct circuit." The GPe is in a pivotal position to regulate the motor output of the BG. Dopamine finely tunes striatal input as well as neuronal striatal activity, and modulates GPe, GPi, and STN activity. Dopaminergic depletion in Parkinson's disease disrupts the corticostriatal balance leading to increased activity the indirect circuit and reduced activity in the direct circuit. The precise chain of events leading to increased STN activity is not completely understood, but impaired dopaminergic regulation of the GPe, GPi, and STN may be involved. The parkinsonian state is characterized by disruption of the internal balance of the BG leading to hyperactivity in the two main entry points of the network (striatum and STN) and excessive inhibitory output from the GPi. Replacement therapy with standard levodopa creates a further imbalance, producing an abnormal pattern of neuronal discharge and synchronization of neuronal firing that sustain the "off" and "on with dyskinesia" states. The effect of levodopa is robust but short-lasting and converts the parkinsonian BG into a highly unstable system, where pharmacological and compensatory effects act in opposing directions. This creates a scenario that substantially departs from the normal physiological state of the BG.},

  abstract = {The cause of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS), a chronic motor and vocal tic disorder of childhood onset, remains unknown. Abnormalities in basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits presumably play an important role in the pathophysiology underlying the involuntary tics. The use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a noninvasive and painless tool to examine the excitability of several different circuits in the human motor cortex has advanced our understanding of the pathophysiology. Motor thresholds are similar in GTS and healthy subjects; in the resting state, recruitment of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) above threshold is more gradual in patients than controls. In contrast, recruitment of MEPs during preactivation is similar in both groups, as is the duration of the cortical silent period. This suggests that the distribution of excitability in the corticospinal system in patients at rest is different to that in healthy individuals. Importantly, correlation analysis showed that reduced levels of excitability at rest relate, in pure GTS patients, to video ratings of complex tics, and hand and finger tics, with less excitability predicting fewer tics. The correlations disappear for measures made during voluntary activation. This suggests that this is an adaptive response to abnormal basal ganglia-motor cortex inputs in an effort to reduce unwanted movements, a notion supported by electroencephalography-coherence studies that show increased cortico-cortical coupling. Compared to the healthy control group, short intracortical inhibition (SICI) thresholds are similar. However, above-threshold SICI recruitment and sensory afferent inhibition (SAI), a paradigm to examine sensory motor integration, are reduced in patients. This is consistent with the suggestion that reduced excitability of cortical inhibition is one factor that contributes to the difficulty that patients have in suppressing involuntary tics. In addition the reduced SAI indicates that impaired intracortical inhibition may not be limited to the motor cortex but also involves circuits linking sensory input and motor output. GTS with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder comorbidity is associated with more extensive changes in the excitability of motor cortex circuits than pure GTS or GTS+obsessive-compulsive disorder. The extent to which various different neuronal circuits are affected may be relevant for the phenotype of Tourette spectrum disorders.},

Specifically, it proposes that motor imagery (MI; imagining an action without executing the movements involved) shares certain mental representations and mechanisms with action execution, and hence, activates similar neural pathways to those elicited during the latter process. Furthermore, MST postulates that MI works by rehearsing neural motor systems off-line via a hypothetical simulation process. In this paper, we review evidence cited in support of MST and evaluate its efficacy in understanding the cognitive mechanisms underlying MI. In doing so, we delineate the precise postulates of simulation theory and clarify relevant terminology. Based on our cognitive-level analysis, we argue firstly that the psychological mechanisms underlying MI are poorly understood and require additional conceptual and empirical analysis. In addition, we identify a number of potentially fruitful lines of inquiry for future investigators of MST and MI.},

On individual trials, higher ratings of vividness predicted a greater likelihood that the imagined pattern would appear dominant when the participant was subsequently presented with the binocular rivalry display. Off-line self-report questionnaires measuring imagery vividness also predicted individual differences in the strength of imagery bias over the entire study. Perceptual bias due to mental imagery could not be attributed to demand characteristics, as no bias was observed on catch-trial presentations of mock rivalry displays.

Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have associated that component with increased metabolic activity in the auditory cortex, including voice-selective areas. It remains to be determined, however, whether this activation arises automatically from early bottom-up visual inputs or whether it depends on late top-down control processes modulated by task demands. To answer this question, we collaborated with four epileptic human patients recorded with intracranial electrodes in the auditory cortex for therapeutic purposes, and measured high-frequency (50\textendash 150 Hz) ``gamma'' activity as a proxy of population level spiking activity. Temporal voice-selective areas (TVAs) were identified with an auditory localizer task and monitored as participants viewed words flashed on screen. We compared neural responses depending on whether words were attended or ignored and found a significant increase of neural activity in response to words, strongly enhanced by attention. In one of the patients, we could record that response at 800 ms in TVAs, but also at 700 ms in the primary auditory cortex and at 300 ms in the ventral occipital temporal cortex. Furthermore, single-trial analysis revealed a considerable jitter between activation peaks in visual and auditory cortices. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the multimodal mental experience of reading is in fact a heterogeneous complex of asynchronous neural responses, and that auditory and visual modalities often process distinct temporal frames of our environment at the same time.},

In rejecting this dichotomy, we instead assert that producing and understanding are interwoven, and that this interweaving is what enables people to predict themselves and each other. We start by noting that production and comprehension are forms of action and action perception. We then consider the evidence for interweaving in action, action perception, and joint action, and explain such evidence in terms of prediction. Specifically, we assume that actors construct forward models of their actions before they execute those actions, and that perceivers of others' actions covertly imitate those actions, then construct forward models of those actions. We use these accounts of action, action perception, and joint action to develop accounts of production, comprehension, and interactive language. Importantly, they incorporate well-defined levels of linguistic representation (such as semantics, syntax, and phonology). We show (a) how speakers and comprehenders use covert imitation and forward modeling to make predictions at these levels of representation, (b) how they interweave production and comprehension processes, and (c) how they use these predictions to monitor the upcoming utterances. We show how these accounts explain a range of behavioral and neuroscientific data on language processing and discuss some of the implications of our proposal.},

We had participants imagine colored Gabor patterns for an hour a day, over the course of five consecutive days, and again two weeks after training. Participants rated the subjective vividness and effort of their mental imagery on each trial. The influence of imagery on subsequent binocular rivalry dominance was taken as our measure of imagery strength. We found no overall effect of training on imagery strength. Training did, however, improve participant's metacognition of imagery. Trial-by-trial ratings of vividness gained predictive power on subsequent rivalry dominance as a function of training. These data suggest that, while imagery strength might be immune to training in the current context, people's metacognitive understanding of mental imagery can improve with practice.},

We will first outline four dimensions along which inhibition can be categorized: intentionality, timing, specificity, and the nature of the to-be-inhibited action. Next, we relate the concept of inhibition to theories of intentional action. In particular, we integrate ideomotor theory with motor control theories that involve predictive forward modeling of the consequences of one׳s action, and evaluate how the dimensional classification of inhibition fits into such an integrative approach. Furthermore, we will outline testable predictions that derive from this novel hypothesis of ideomotor inhibition. We then discuss the viability of the ideomotor inhibition hypothesis and our classification in view of the available evidence on the neural mechanisms of action inhibition, indicating that sensorimotor and ideomotor inhibition engages largely overlapping networks with additional recruitment of dFMC for ideomotor inhibition.},

Further, in Experiment 2 we manipulated correction instructions (whether or not to correct errors) and controlled for visual feedback in executed typing (letters appearing on the screen or not). Participants executed and imagined typing proverbs of different lengths. Errors and error corrections explained a significant amount of variance of execution minus imagination differences in Experiment 1, and in Experiment 2 when participants were instructed to correct errors, but not when participants were instructed not to correct errors. In Experiment 2 participants corrected and reported more errors with than without visual feedback. However, the relation between execution \`A imagination duration differences and errors and error corrections was unaffected by visual feedback. The types of errors reported less often in imagination than in execution were related to processes in typing execution. We conclude that errors and error corrections are not spontaneously imagined during motor imagery, and that even when attention is drawn to their occurrence only some are imagined. This may be due to forward models not predicting all aspects of an action, imprecise forward models, or a neglect of monitoring error signals during motor imagery.},

Distinct neurons in the frontal eye field respond to visual stimuli or control the production of the movements. In the supplementary eye field and anterior cingulate cortex, neurons appear not to control directly movement initiation but instead signal the production of errors, the anticipation and delivery of reinforcement, and the presence of processing conflict.

  abstract = {Research on motor imagery proposes that overt actions during motor imagery can be avoided by proactively signaling subthreshold motor commands to the effectors and by invoking motor-command inhibition. A recent study by Rieger, Dahm, and Koch (2017) found evidence in support of motor command inhibition, which indicates that MI cannot be completed on the sole basis of subthreshold motor commands. However, during motor imagery, participants know in advance when a covert response is to be made and it is thus surprising such additional motor-command inhibition is needed. Accordingly, the present study tested whether the demand to perform an action covertly can be proactively integrated by investigating the formation of task-specific action rules during motor imagery. These task-specific action rules relate the decision rules of a task to the mode in which these rules need to be applied (e.g., if smaller than 5, press the left key covertly). To this end, an experiment was designed in which participants had to switch between two numerical judgement tasks and two response modes: covert responding and overt responding. First, we observed markers of motor command inhibition and replicated the findings of Rieger and colleagues. Second, we observed evidence suggesting that task-specific action rules are created for the overt response mode (e.g., if smaller than 5, press the left key). In contrast, for the covert response mode, no task-specific action rules are formed and decision rules do not include mode-specific information (e.g., if smaller than 5, left).},

We discuss the implications of these stopping subprocesses for the interpretation of the stop-signal reaction time\textemdash in particular, some activity that seems too slow to causally contribute to stopping when assuming a single Stop processes may actually be fast enough under a Pause-then-Cancel model.

When imagining hand movements, CW executed the imagined motor act but was unaware of the movements. These movements were significantly more accurate than volitional movements for the left but not right hand. CW also exhibited preserved motor imagery for the left but not right hand. Consistent with previous accounts, these findings suggest that motor imagery may normally involve the inhibition of movements. CW's unawareness of movements during motor imagery may reflect inattention or misattribution of the unexpected sensory feedback. Furthermore, in line with current models of motor control, motor imagery may depend on the integrity of a ``forward model'' derived from motor outflow information to generate a prediction of the consequences of a motor command. Such predictions appear to be preserved for imagery of left but not right hand movements in CW. Action may additionally depend on precise updating of effector position derived from the comparison of predicted and actual sensory information. We propose that CW's impaired volitional movements may be attributable to the degradation of such an updating mechanism. \'O 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

In recent years, a number of studies have confirmed the laryngeal motor cortical representation in humans and have provided some information about its interactions with other cortical and subcortical regions that are principally involved in vocal motor control of speech production. In this review, the authors discuss the organization of the peripheral and central laryngeal control based on neuroimaging and electrical stimulation studies in humans and neuroanatomical tracing studies in nonhuman primates. It is hypothesized that the location of the laryngeal motor cortex in the primary motor cortex and its direct connections with the brain stem laryngeal motoneurons in humans, as opposed to its location in the premotor cortex with only indirect connections to the laryngeal motoneurons in nonhuman primates, may represent one of the major evolutionary developments in humans toward the ability to speak and vocalize voluntarily.},

  abstract = {How do we recognize objects despite differences in their retinal projections when they are seen at different orientations? Marr and Nishihara (1978) proposed that shapes are represented in memory as structural descriptions in object-centered coordinate systems, so that an object is represented identically regardless of its orientation. An alternative hypothesis is that an object is represented in memory in a single representation corresponding to a canonical orientation, and a mental rotation operation transforms an input shape into that orientation before input and memory are compared. A third possibility is that shapes are stored in a set of representations, each corresponding to a different orientation. In four experiments, subjects studied several objects each at a single orientation, and were given extensive practice at naming them quickly, or at classifying them as normal or mirror-reversed, at several orientations. At first, response times increased with departure from the study orientation, with a slope similar to those obtained in classic mental rotation experiments. This suggests that subjects made both judgments by mentally transforming the orientation of the input shape to the one they had initially studied. With practice, subjects recognized the objects almost equally quickly at all the familiar orientations. At that point they were probed with the same objects appearing at novel orientations. Response times for these probes increased with increasing disparity from the previously trained orientations. This indicates that subjects had stored representations of the shapes at each of the practice orientations and recognized shapes at the new orientations by rotating them to one of the stored orientations. The results are consistent with a hybrid of the second (mental transformation) and third (multiple view) hypotheses of shape recognition: input shapes are transformed to a stored view, either the one at the nearest orientation or one at a canonical orientation. Interestingly, when mirrorimages of trained shapes were presented for naming, subjects took the same time at all orientations. This suggests that mental transformations of orientation can take the shortest path of rotation that will align an input shape and its memorized counterpart, in this case a rotation in depth about an axis in the picture plane.},

  abstract = {The neural basis of mental imagery has been investigated by localizing the underlying neural networks, mostly in motor and perceptual systems, separately. However, how modality-specific representations are top-down induced and how the action and perception systems interact in the context of mental imagery is not well understood. Imagined speech production (`articulation imagery'), which induces the kinesthetic feeling of articulator movement and its auditory consequences, provides a new angle because of the concurrent involvement of motor and perceptual systems. On the basis of previous findings in mental imagery of speech, we argue for the following regarding the induction mechanisms of mental imagery and the interaction between motor and perceptual systems: (1) Two distinct top-down mechanisms, memory retrieval and motor simulation, exist to induce estimation in perceptual systems. (2) Motor simulation is sufficient to internally induce the representation of perceptual changes that would be caused by actual movement (perceptual associations); however, this simulation process only has modulatory effects on the perception of external stimuli, which critically depends on context and task demands. Considering the proposed simulation-estimation processes as common mechanisms for interaction between motor and perceptual systems, we outline how mental imagery (of speech) relates to perception and production, and how these hypothesized mechanisms might underpin certain neural disorders.},

  abstract = {Sensory cortices can be activated without any external stimuli. Yet, it is still unclear how this perceptual reactivation occurs and which neural structures mediate this reconstruction process. In this study, we employed fMRI with mental imagery paradigms to investigate the neural networks involved in perceptual reactivation. Subjects performed two speech imagery tasks: articulation imagery (AI) and hearing imagery (HI). We found that AI induced greater activity in frontal-parietal sensorimotor systems, including sensorimotor cortex, subcentral (BA 43), middle frontal cortex (BA 46) and parietal operculum (PO), whereas HI showed stronger activation in regions that have been implicated in memory retrieval: middle frontal (BA 8), inferior parietal cortex and intraparietal sulcus. Moreover, posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and anterior superior temporal gyrus (aSTG) was activated more in AI compared with HI, suggesting that covert motor processes induced stronger perceptual reactivation in the auditory cortices. These results suggest that motorto-perceptual transformation and memory retrieval act as two complementary mechanisms to internally reconstruct corresponding perceptual outcomes. These two mechanisms can serve as a neurocomputational foundation for predicting perceptual changes, either via a previously learned relationship between actions and their perceptual consequences or via stored perceptual experiences of stimulus and episodic or contextual regularity.},

  abstract = {Objectives Motor imagery (MI) is a dynamic mental state during which the representation of a given motor movement is rehearsed in working memory without overt motor output. Mental practice (MP; also known as motor imagery practice) is the systematic application of MI for the cognitive rehearsal of a task in the absence of overt physical movements. Although MP is known to enhance skilled performance, debate still exists about the magnitude and moderators of these imagery effects. Against this background, and amid concerns about the ``reproducibility crisis'' in psychology, it seems timely to revisit, update and extend a key meta-analysis of MP effects published over two decades ago \textendash{} namely, that of Driskell, Copper, and Moran (1994). To this end, the present paper reports a methodological replication of the Driskell et al's (1994) meta-analysis of MP effects. Design \& method Included are 37 studies on MP effects published between 1995 and 2018. Nine factors were selected to examine the extent to which they moderate the effectiveness of mental practice, providing a window into the conditions under which mental practice is most effectively implemented. Practice Type (Mental or Physical), Expertise, Duration of practice (both program and session), Task Type, and Control Type were retained as factors of interest from the original Driskell et al. (1994) meta-analysis. In order to further explore the nuance of mental practice implementation, we additionally examined the Imagery Type, the Performance Measure used, Activity Type (team versus individual activities) and the Setting of the intervention. Results Following publication bias analyses, our results confirm that overall, MP has a small but significant positive effect on performance (r~=~0.131). Moderators of this beneficial effect were MP duration, type of task and type of imagery used. Conclusions We conclude that MP has an enduring positive influence on performance.},

We examined the possibility that perception of speech, both auditory and visual, would also result in changes in the excitability of the motor system underlying speech production. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied to the face area of primary motor cortex to elicit motor-evoked potentials in the lip muscles. The size of the motor-evoked potentials was compared under the following conditions: listening to speech, listening to non-verbal sounds, viewing speech-related lip movements, and viewing eye and brow movements. Compared to control conditions, listening to and viewing speech enhanced the size of the motor-evoked potential. This effect was only seen in response to stimulation of the left hemisphere; stimulation of the right hemisphere produced no changes in motor-evoked potentials in any of the conditions. In a control experiment, the size of the motor-evoked potentials elicited in the muscles of the right hand did not differ among conditions, suggesting that speech-related changes in excitability are specific to the lip muscles. These results provide evidence that both auditory and visual speech perception facilitate the excitability of the motor system involved in speech production.},

Behavior psychology has been called physiology, muscle-twitch psychology and biology, but if it helps to rid us of the constraints of present-day conventional psychology and teaches us to face the human being more directly, what name it is given is not a matter of much consequence. Behavior psychology has had a rapid development and is a direct outgrowth of work on animal behavior. While behavior psychology borrows from conditioned reflex methods and psychopathologists, it is neither an objective psychology nor a modified system of psychoanalysis. The present volume disrupts the traditional classification of psychological topics and their conventional treatment. Terms such as consciousness, sensation, perception, attention, will, image and the like are avoided by the author due to his belief that they are used inconsistently and have unclear meanings. Terms such as thinking and memory have been redefined to conform with behavioristic psychology. Also, in this text the author has clung to the genetic method rather closely in hopes that students grasp the genesis of the various types of organization.

They come in several varieties\textemdash action errors, unexpected action outcomes, and unexpected perceptual events\textemdash and they lead to motor slowing and cognitive distraction. While different varieties of unexpected events have been studied largely independently, and many different mechanisms are thought to explain their effects on action and cognition, we suggest a unifying theory. We propose that unexpected events recruit a fronto-basal-ganglia network for stopping. This network includes specific prefrontal cortical nodes and is posited to project to the subthalamic nucleus, with a putative global suppressive effect on basal-ganglia output. We argue that unexpected events interrupt action and impact cognition, partly at least, by recruiting this global suppressive network. This provides a common mechanistic basis for different types of unexpected events; links the literatures on motor inhibition, performance monitoring, attention, and working memory; and is relevant for understanding clinical symptoms of distractibility and mental inflexibility.},

However, rapid sequences of highly dexterous behaviors, such as handwriting or touch typing, might enable faster communication rates. Here, we demonstrate an intracortical BCI that can decode imagined handwriting movements from neural activity in motor cortex and translate it to text in real-time, using a novel recurrent neural network decoding approach. With this BCI, our study participant (whose hand was paralyzed) achieved typing speeds that exceed those of any other BCI yet reported: 90 characters per minute at \&gt;99\% accuracy with a general-purpose autocorrect. These speeds are comparable to able-bodied smartphone typing speeds in our participant's age group (115 characters per minute)\textsuperscript{8} and significantly close the gap between BCI-enabled typing and able-bodied typing rates. Finally, new theoretical considerations explain why temporally complex movements, such as handwriting, may be fundamentally easier to decode than point-to-point movements. Our results open a new approach for BCIs and demonstrate the feasibility of accurately decoding rapid, dexterous movements years after paralysis.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Humans can perform, perceive, and imagine voluntary movement. Numerous investigations of these abilities have employed variants of goal-directed aiming tasks because the Fitts's law equation reliably captures the mathematical relationship between movement time (MT) and accuracy requirements. The emergence of Fitts's speed-accuracy relationship during movement execution, perception, and imagination has led to the suggestion that these processes rely on common neural codes. This common coding account is based on the notion that the neural codes used to generate an action are tightly bound to the codes that represent the perceptual consequences of that action. It is suggested that during action imagination and perception the bound codes are activated offline through an action simulation. The present study provided a comprehensive testing of this common coding hypothesis by examining the characteristics of the Fitts relationship in movement execution, perception, and imagination within the same individuals. Participants were required to imagine and perceive reciprocal aiming movements with varying accuracy requirements before and after actually executing the movements. Consistent with the common coding account, the Fitts relationship was observed in all conditions. Critically, the slopes of the regression lines across tasks were not different suggesting that the core of the speed-accuracy trade-off was consistent across conditions. In addition, it was found that incidental limb position variability scaled to the amplitude of imagined movements. This motor overflow suggests motor system activation during action imagination. Overall, the results support the hypothesis that action execution, perception, and imagination rely on a common coding system.},
