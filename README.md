# The role of motor inhibition during covert speech production

## Abstract

Covert speech is accompanied by a subjective multisensory experience with auditory and kinaesthetic components. An influential hypothesis states that these sensory percepts result from a simulation of the corresponding motor action that relies on the same internal models recruited for the control of overt speech. A significant consequence of this hypothesis is that the sensory experience of covert speech would be continuously shaped by sensorimotor interactions with the environment. However, the precise computations required by these internal models and their neural implementation remain unclear. Moreover, this simulationnist view raises the question of how it is possible to imagine actions without executing them. In this perspective, we focus on covert speech as an exciting case study to help understanding the interplay between language, motor control, and perceptual processes.
