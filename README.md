# The role of motor inhibition during covert speech production

## Abstract

Covert speech is accompanied by a subjective multisensory experience with auditory and kinaesthetic components. An influential hypothesis states that these sensory percepts result from a simulation of the corresponding motor action that relies on the same internal models recruited for the control of overt speech. A significant consequence of this hypothesis is that the sensory experience of covert speech would be continuously shaped by sensorimotor interactions with the environment. However, the precise computations required by these internal models and their neural implementation remain unclear. Moreover, this simulationnist view raises the question of how it is possible to imagine speech without executing it. In this perspective, we highlight the role of motor inhibition during covert speech production. We suggest that considering covert speech as an inhibited form of overt speech maps naturally to the purported progressive internalisation of overt speech during childhood. However, we argue that the role of motor inhibition may differ widely across different forms of covert speech (e.g., condensed vs. expanded covert speech) and that considering this variety helps reconciling seemingly contradictory findings from the neuroimaging literature.
