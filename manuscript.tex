\begin{abstract}

\noindent Humans have a remarkable ability to imagine actions without executing them. Such motor imagery is accompanied by a subjective multi-sensory experience with auditory, visual, and kinaesthetic components. An influential hypothesis states that these sensory percepts result from a simulation of the corresponding motor action that relies on the same internal models recruited for the control of overt actions. A significant consequence of this hypothesis is that the sensory experience of covert actions would be continuously shaped by sensorimotor interactions with the environment. However, the precise computations required by these internal models and their neural implementation remain unclear. Moreover, this simulationnist view raises the question of how it is possible to imagine actions without executing them. In this perspective, we focus on covert verbal actions such as covert speech, writing, or typing, as an exciting case study to help understanding the interplay between language, motor control, and perceptual processes. 

% Since the first explorations of the phenomenological and psychophysiological properties of imagined actions, there has been considerable efforts and progresses towards describing the mechanisms leading to these sensory percepts.

\section{Introduction}

% Succinct introduction in four paragraphs.
% 1) Introduction of motor imagery
% 2) Covert verbals actions
% 3) Relating 1) and 2) to the thematic of the research topic
% 4) Aims of the present perspective

Motor imagery can be defined as the mental process by which one rehearses an action, without engaging in the physical movements involved in this particular action...

Because speech production results from sequences of motor commands which are assembled to reach a given communication goal, it belongs to the broader category of motor actions \citep{jeannerod_motor_2006}. Therefore, a parallel can be drawn between covert speech and other forms of covert verbal actions (e.g., covert signing, covert writing, covert typing) and, more generally, of motor imagery...

\subsection{Sensory content: Simulation vs. association}

Simulation or association? Direct or indirect routes? Depends on situational (e.g., surrounding noise) and intrinsic (e.g., expertise), in brief on computational cost/resource, concept of memoisation \citep{dasgupta_memory_2021}...

In other words, situational (extrinsic) and individual (intrinsic) characteristics jointly determine the computational cost (or equivalently, the available computational resources), which in turn determines the balance between the simulation and association mechanisms. Novel and/or difficult tasks may rely more on the simulation mechanism whereas well known tasks may rely more...

\subsection{Development and novel actions}

How learning does affect sensory experience? Can we use internal models to imagine totally novel (i.e., never executed actions)?

\section{Covert verbal actions as inhibited verbal actions}

% For the sake of clarity, we need to make a distinction between at least two different types of inhibition: the inhibition of physical response (e.g., planning to raise the arm and finally not doing it), and the idea of cognitive inhibition, defined as "the stopping or overriding of a mental process, in whole or in part, with or without intention" (MacLeod, 2007). In the current project, we are concerned with the former, which can be defined broadly as the withholding, suppression, or overriding of an inappropriate, prepotent, or unwanted motor response (Aron, 2007; Oâ€™Shea \& Moran, 2018).

% To be even more precise, Ridderinkhof et al. (2014) described the concept of response inhibition on three continuous dimensions (intentionality, premeditation, specificity). Inhibition can be employed with more or less intentionality (intentional versus reactive inhibition), planned ahead or employed in the moment (early versus late inhibition), and more or less specifically (global inhibition versus effector-specific or action-specific inhibition). More detailed categorisation of inhibitory mechanisms can occur in this three-dimensional space but for the current purpose it is sufficient to say that we are interested (purportedly) in an intentional (we know we want to produce motor imagery rather than overt execution) but automatic (we do not explicitly think about not producing movements), planned ahead (proactive), and possibly global form of response inhibition...

\subsection{Motor imagery as inhibited execution}

% In other words, despite the involvement of the motor system in providing the sensory experience of the covert action, how can we imagine raising our arm without actually raising our arm?
